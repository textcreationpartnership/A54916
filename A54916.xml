            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that this Bleſſed Virgine, notwithſtanding all theſe huge aduantages and prerogatiues of grace, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to s.

Nay aske the Iewes, and (notwithſtanding their endleſſe malice) euen by them you may informe your ſelfe of the truth; for looke vp and you may reade their inſcription; IESVS, N. R.

The perſecuted becomes the perſecutours Aduocate, euen in the act of perſecuting him The dying Lord, turnes his dead, and dying ſlaues Patron, euen while he is bloodily ſtriking at his hart, Father, He makes his addreſſe to him, not ſo much in qualitie of God, whom he knowes to be actually prouoked to reuenge, as of Father, whoſe bowells are all mercie, for his prodigall children. Father: what confidence may not poore ſinners conceaue, when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch a father; is ſued to, by a ſonne, and ſuch a ſonne? Father, I begge not reuenge for what I ſuffer, but pardon for thoſe, for whom, and by whom, I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: <hi>Father pardonne them:</hi> I ſue not that the world should be iudged for me, but

I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Pilates iniuſtice (which is ſo much more cryminal, by how much his owne conſcience pleades guiltie againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for condemning a perſon in whom he found noe guilte) nor the Prieſts and Princes inueterate malice; nor the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers crueltie; nor the peoples falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſcornes, and blaſphemie. But by how much their crymes are more cleare, ther pardon is more neceſſarily petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for: by how much their miſerie is more deſparatly great, by ſo much thy great mercy is more abſolutly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored; haue mercy therfor vpon them according to thy great mercy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. Pardon them, I ſay heauenly
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100502:383"/> Father, for they know not what they doe. The penall ignorance which runs all along through their actions, though it excuſeth not, yet it much extenuates their tranſgreſſion. They know not, they apprehend not, that they arme their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt that infinite charitie, which flames vp ſo high amidſt the ſame mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that all the floodes of their furie is not able to extinguish it. They know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that they putt an innocent man to death, but they know not that they Crucifie the God of glorie. Tis enough, my deareſt Lord, thou haſt powerfully pleaded and wunne poore man's cauſe, which without thy plea, and thy price, was irrecouerably loſt for euer. Thou art heard for thyne owne reuerence; and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions shall be giuen to thy prayers and merites.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But ah my ſoule! is it not true that as this leſſon brings comfort to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian harts, ſo it loades them with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and fixeth shame vpon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades. He couers, in ſome ſort, the Iewes crymes and confuſion with a plea of ignorance: for had they had an abſolute knowledge, of what they did, and to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:100502:384"/> they had neuer crucified the Lord of glorie. But we ſeeing &amp; knowing by the light of faith (which is a more abſolute aſſurance then any demonſtration, then all humane knowledge can afford) and being bound, &amp; ſtanding readie in the preparation of our hart to putt downe our life for it, that it was God &amp; man, the verie God of glorie that they putt to death, we, I ſay, make noe difficultie to crucifie him againe by our dayly crymes; to treade the ſonne of God vnder foote, and to eſteeme the bloude of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment polluted.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. We acknowledge that we are taught by the mouth of eternall truth it ſelfe (vnleſſe we haue renounced all Chriſtianitie) and we euen ſee it in his owne example, that we are to returne Good, for euill, and we contrarily, render euill for good: hatred for loue, diſreſpect for good offices; neglect forcares; ingratitude for greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. We haue ſeene our Chriſt, ſadd to death, betrayed, taken, bound, abuſed, reuiled, ſcorned, boxed, ſpitt in the face, whipped, crowned with thornes, blaſpheamed, crucified: and we
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100502:384"/> heare him from the ſame Croſſe preach, plead, pray for pardon. And yet we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, alas! who as we take our name from Chriſt, ſo should his actions be the rules of our life, and our conformitie to the ſame rules, the perfection therof, liuing as it were, by the law of contraries, run quite contre. The Maſter cryes for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: the ſcholler exacts reuenge. The maſters wiſdome and charitie finds wayes to couer multitudes of enormious cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: and the ſchollers iniquitie and madneſſe, inuents meanes to make Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehills appeare montaines, and to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie a few ſmale faultes into huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The maſter, by a Rethorique brought from Heauen endeuours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate a viſible iniurie by alleaging ignorance, which though otherwiſe afected, did in ſome ſorte leſſen the cryme. The ſcholler by a Sophiſtrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented in Hell, ſtriues to aggrauate, euen almoſt inuiſible faults, from the place in which it was done, the tyme, the manner &amp;c. And if none of theſe ſeeme vigorous enough, he gueſſes at the intention of him that did it, and will needes haue it to be ſuch as his Paſſion hath framed it
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:100502:385"/> in his mynd. In fine the ſcholler hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harte, nor hand, nor tongue, to plead excuſe, to worke, or wishe well too, euen a ſeeming enemy, though otherwiſe a true friend indeede; He will not take the paines to conſider, that the miſintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was but cauſed, at moſt, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, inconſideration, precipitation; and to take it at the higheſt, that it was but man, ſinfull man, man ſubiect to all the ſame deſeaſes, that rather tooke, then had offence giuen him. While the Maſter neither hauing hand nor foote free, but onely a hartfull of mercye, and a tongue free and readie to expreſſe the ſame, imployes it to begge pardon for thoſe wretches which ignominiouſly murder a God, ſaying: <hi>Father pardon them, for they knovv not vvhat they doe.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>One of thy prime Prophetes, who was the pen which putt downe thy truth, aſſures vs, that being growen old, as then he was, he had neuer yet ſeene a iuſt man forſaken: how then doe we heare not the iuſt man onely, but euen iuſtice it ſelfe crying to thee, <hi>vvhy haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Thou haſt promiſed thyne ordinarie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, to beare one end of the yoake with them: to be with them in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to deliuer them; to glorifie them.

                     <p>O ſweete Ieſu, I offer vnto thee for all my ſinnes, vanities, negligences, and diſtractions, thoſe incomprehenſible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which thou ſufferedſtw, when being expoſed to ſuch anguishe, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100502:397"/> of all conſolation, thou didſt hange in a miſerable manner on the Croſſe betwixt two theeues; and when burninge with exceſſiue thirſt, they gaue thee noe thinge but vineger and gale to drinke. I offer that exceeding charitie, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercy, with which inclyninge thy venerable heade, thou rendredſt vp the Ghoſt. I offer that ſaueing bloud and water which flowed from thy pierced ſide. All this I offer thee; beſeeching that immenſe clemencie of thyne, that by the merite therof thou wouldſt fullie purifie my ſoule, render it pleaſing to thee and conduct it to life euerlaſtinge.</p>
                     <p>O ſweete Ieſu, for the perfect remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all my offences, which in all my life tyme I haue in any wiſe committed I offer vnto thee the whole worke of mans redemption performed by thee.

I offer what euer els may haue bene gratefull to thee at any tyme, in thy moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mother the Bleſſed Virgine Marie, and in thoſe other Saintes of thyne. O moſt ſweete Ieſu I beſeech thee, may thyne innocencie fullie ſatisfie thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:100502:397"/> for my guiltineſſe. Shroud in the pureſt ſyndon of thy merites, all my too vnworthy, and ſinfull life; that what is vncleane in me by being conioyned to them, and what is imperfect by being vnited to them, may be perfected; that ſo during this life I may be pleaſing to thee, and hauing-finished the courſe of this miſerable pilgrimage I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently arriue home to thee, who art eternall ſaluation, to glorifie thy B. Name for euer. Amen.</p>
